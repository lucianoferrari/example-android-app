# example-android-app
This is an example of an Android app that can be used for educational purposes. It's part of my car hacking course at [lufsec.com](https://www.lufsec.com/product/car-hacking-keyfob-to-full-exploitation/), Unit 4 Mobile and Firmware Exploitation, Lesson 2 MOBILE SECURITY FRAMEWORK (MobSF) FOR AUTOMOTIVE APPS - where I use MobSF to run a static analysis against this basic android app.
