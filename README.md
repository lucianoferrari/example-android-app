# example-android-app
This is an example of an Android app that can be used for educational purposes. It's part of my car hacking course at [lufsec.com] (lufsec.com), Unit 4 Mobile and Firmware Exploitation, Lesson 2 MOBILE SECURITY FRAMEWORK (MobSF) FOR AUTOMOTIVE APPS - where I use MobSF to run a static analysis against this basic android app.
